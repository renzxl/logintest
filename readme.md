#Using Pluralsight Building Angular and Node.js Apps with the Mean Stack
## replaced mongodb with postgresQL


**setup passport**

```

var express = require('express'),
           **passport= require('passport'),**
            **LocalStrategy = require('passport-local').Strategy;**
```


# Building a PEAN Application (PostgresQL, Express, Angular, and NodeJS)

This is an example of creating an application that includes a local security strateggy using passport.


## Getting Started

1) Make a clone of the code
2) Install PostgresQL. You can also use MongDB or any other DB instead


### Prerequisities

1) Install PostgresQL: http://postgresapp.com/
2) Clone: https://github.com/renzxl/logintest.


### Installing

1) A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Stay what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Acknowledgments

* Hat's off to Joe Eames. In my opinion, he developed one of the best plural sight classes that can easily be followed.Hat tip to anyone who's code was used
* Joe used MongDB instead of PostgreSQL. He highlights areas where the video instructions no longer matches new versions of
* packages. The course is about 4 hours, but well worth the time. If you follow along, it will take you well north of 4 hours
* with typos and just trying to understand how the application works. If you are familiar with NodeJS, you be able
* to complete the class much faster. Link to course: https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/building-angularjs-nodejs-apps-mean/table-of-contents
